import { PackageManagers } from 'starlight-package-managers'

Get started by installing Document Builder and its peer dependencies:

<PackageManagers pkg='dynamo-document-builder zod @aws-sdk/client-dynamodb @aws-sdk/lib-dynamodb' />

## Define your Table

Document Builder follows [Single Table](https://www.alexdebrie.com/posts/dynamodb-single-table) design, to get started we'll first need to define our table:

```ts
import { DynamoDBClient } from '@aws-sdk/client-dynamodb';
import { DynamoDBDocumentClient } from '@aws-sdk/lib-dynamodb';
import { DynamoTable } from 'dynamo-document-builder';

const dynamoClient = new DynamoDBClient();
const documentClient = DynamoDBDocumentClient.from(dynamoClient);

const exampleTable = new DynamoTable({
  name: 'ExampleTable',
  documentClient,
  keyNames: {
    partitionKey: 'PK',
    sortKey: 'SK',
  },
});
```

<Aside variant="info" title="Note about table creation">
  Dynamo Document Builder does not handle the actual creation of your DynamoDB table.
  For that its recommended to use an infra-as-code tool such as the [AWS CDK](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/v2/docs/aws-cdk-lib.aws_dynamodb-readme.html)
  or [Terraform](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/-/aws/6.13.0/docs/resources/dynamodb_table).
</Aside>

Now that we have our table, we can define the entities that belong to it.
